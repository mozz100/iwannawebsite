I work in/on the web, and I frequently get asked “Can you make me a website?”.

I've built lots of ’em, so it's a fair enough question.

What someone means when they say “a website” varies hugely from person to person.  So
I collected my “Frequently ask questions” (*sic*) and, here they are.

As an exercise and a demonstration, this site itself is hosted on github pages using 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  It costs me nothing!
